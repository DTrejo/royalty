Royalty
====

Code like kings & queens.
---

This is a project skeleton optimized for developer happiness, speed, and
luxury. Just like a Ferrari, or a silken royal purple cape.

### What is it like to be royalty?

- Your CSS changes show themselves in the browser immediately — no more
  refreshing!
- Your server-side js modifications cause the server to restart — never
  alt-tab to your command line and ^C again!
- When you add a new `require` statement to your code, the module is
  automatically downloaded by npm into your node_modules folder.

#### Summary
<!-- - vogue reloads your css on change -->
<!-- - node-dev reruns your server on change -->
<!-- - never write AJAX routes again with Now.js -->

### Getting started

Copy and paste these commands into your terminal:

    git clone git://github.com/DTrejo/royalty.git
    cd royalty
    npm install .

    #
    # At your service.
    #
    ./runserver.sh &
    ./reloadcss.sh &

    # see it in action
    open http://localhost:8000/
